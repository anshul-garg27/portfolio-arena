# The Portfolio Arena

### 18+ unique portfolio concepts, built from scratch, competing head-to-head.

I set out to build the world's best developer portfolio. Instead of picking one design, I built **18 completely different interactive demos** -- from archaeological dig sites to AI chat interfaces, from courtroom trials to photographer's darkrooms.

Every demo is a single HTML file. No frameworks. No build tools. Just open and explore.
