## THE ABSOLUTE BEST NEW IDEAS (Not Yet Built)

### TOP 10 - "BUILD THESE FIRST"

1. **"Vibe Coded" Portfolio** - THE meme of 2025-2026. Satirical portfolio "built by vibes." Things slowly break. AI sidebar shows prompts. "Vibe debugging is the hard part."

2. **"Destroy This Homepage"** - Rafael Caferati won 3 Site of the Day awards. Button says "Don't be shy, destroy it." Shooting game blasts the page apart. IRRESISTIBLE.

3. **Google Search Results** - Type "best developer walmart" and results ARE the portfolio. Featured snippet, People Also Ask, Knowledge Panel.

4. **Crafting Game (neal.fun style)** - Combine elements to learn about you. "React" + "Commerce" = "Checkout Optimizer". Infinite Craft was 3rd most searched game of 2024.

5. **Future Medieval** - Blackletter gothic type + holographic neon gradients. Illuminated manuscript borders + cyberpunk. THE trending aesthetic of 2026.

6. **Slack Workspace** - Full Slack clone. #general = about, #projects, #random = fun facts. DMs = contact. Reactions, threads.

7. **Dating Profile / Tinder** - Swipe right to hire! Bio, photos (projects), interests (skills). Match animation.

8. **E-Commerce Product Page** - Amazon-style "Anshull Garg - Software Developer." 4.8 stars, 847 reviews, "Add to Team" button, Q&A.

9. **Netflix Browse** - Projects as "shows." Categories, hover = preview, "Continue Watching" = current work.

10. **ClickClickClick Surveillance Art** - Portfolio narrates what the viewer is doing. Shows their screen resolution, timezone, mouse patterns. Makes them uncomfortable, then shows your work.

13. **Y3K Hyperfuturism** - Liquid chrome blobs, holographic gradients, alien typography. Beyond Y2K.
