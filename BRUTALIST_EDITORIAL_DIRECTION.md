# BRUTALIST / EDITORIAL CREATIVE DIRECTION
## A World-Class Developer Portfolio for Anshull Garg, Software Developer at Walmart

---

## THE ARGUMENT: WHY BRUTALIST/EDITORIAL IS THE ONLY CHOICE

Every developer portfolio you have ever seen looks the same. A gradient hero. A floating 3D sphere. "Hi, I'm [name]" in some safe geometric sans-serif. Smooth scroll animations. A dark mode toggle. Cards with rounded corners. It is all the same template wearing different clothes.

**This direction burns the template.**

Brutalist/Editorial is the design language of confidence. It says: "I do not need a gradient to prove I am good." It borrows from the most respected visual traditions in human history -- newspaper front pages, magazine spreads, Swiss design, Constructivist posters -- and translates them into a digital experience that hiring managers and engineering leads will remember for weeks.

Here is the truth nobody tells junior and mid-level developers: **recruiters see 200+ portfolios a week.** Every single "modern, clean, minimal" portfolio blurs into the same beige noise. A Brutalist/Editorial portfolio is a pattern interrupt. It forces the viewer to stop, read, and engage. It communicates three things instantly:

1. **This developer has taste.** Not default taste. Actual, intentional, opinionated taste.
2. **This developer can build anything.** The technical complexity of an editorial grid system with asymmetric layouts, complex CSS Grid, and intentional typography is orders of magnitude harder than slapping Tailwind defaults on a hero section.
3. **This developer thinks differently.** At Walmart -- a company building at massive scale -- the ability to think beyond conventions is the exact signal that separates senior engineers from the crowd.

This is not chaos for chaos's sake. This is **controlled brutality** -- every raw edge, every oversized typeface, every broken grid is a deliberate decision. That is what makes it world-class.

---

## 1. VISUAL IDENTITY

### Core Philosophy
**"The Daily Build"** -- The portfolio is structured as a broadsheet newspaper / editorial publication. The developer's career, projects, and skills are presented as editorial content: headlines, columns, pull quotes, bylines, and datelines. The entire site feels like you picked up a single-issue publication dedicated to one developer's work.

### Design Principles

- **Raw over polished.** No gradients. No soft shadows. No rounded corners. Hard edges. Visible grid lines. Borders that mean something.
- **Typography IS the design.** In editorial/brutalist work, the typeface does the heavy lifting. No icons. No illustrations. Words, set powerfully.
- **Hierarchy through scale, not color.** A 200px headline next to 14px body copy creates more drama than any color gradient.
- **Intentional discomfort.** Elements that overlap. Text that runs to the edge. White space that is aggressive, not passive. Columns of wildly different widths.
- **Newsprint texture.** Subtle paper grain, visible column rules (thin vertical lines between columns), datelines, issue numbers, and editorial metadata.

### Grid System
A CSS Grid-based asymmetric column system inspired by broadsheet newspapers:
- **12-column base grid** with intentional span breaking
- Column rules (1px solid lines) between content sections
- Elements that span 2, 3, 5, or 7 columns deliberately -- never evenly
- Horizontal rules with varying weights (hairline to 4px bold)
- "Above the fold" and "below the fold" as literal scroll-based metaphors

## 2. COLOR PALETTES

### Palette A: "INKWELL" (Recommended)
The definitive newspaper palette. Stark. Authoritative. Timeless.

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Background | Aged Newsprint | `#F2F0EB` |
| Primary Text | Press Black | `#1A1A1A` |
| Secondary Text | Column Gray | `#6B6B6B` |
| Accent (links, highlights) | Editorial Red | `#C41E3A` |
| Rule Lines / Borders | Ink Gray | `#2D2D2D` |
| Highlight / Selection | Yellowed Highlight | `#E8D44D` |

**Why it works:** This is the palette of the New York Times, the London Review of Books, and every credible broadsheet in history. The aged newsprint background (#F2F0EB) is warmer and more sophisticated than white. The red accent (#C41E3A -- crimson, not cherry) is the color of "BREAKING" and "EXCLUSIVE" -- it marks the elements that matter. The yellowed highlight mimics a physical highlighter dragged across newsprint. This palette screams credibility.

---

### Palette B: "CONCRETE & SIGNAL"
Inspired by Brutalist architecture and industrial signage. Cold. Structural. One electric jolt.

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Background | Raw Concrete | `#E8E4DE` |
| Primary Text | Carbon Black | `#0D0D0D` |
| Secondary Text | Rebar Gray | `#787878` |
| Accent | Safety Orange | `#FF6700` |
| Rule Lines / Borders | Cement Dark | `#3A3A3A` |
| Highlight / Selection | Caution Yellow | `#FFD100` |

**Why it works:** This pulls directly from the physical world of Brutalist architecture -- the raw concrete (#E8E4DE) of a Le Corbusier building, the safety orange (#FF6700) of a construction warning sign. It communicates "under construction" in the best possible way -- a developer who is always building, always iterating. The orange is aggressive enough to draw the eye but warm enough to feel intentional, not garish.

---

### Palette C: "DARK EDITION"
The evening edition. For when the lights go down and the work speaks louder.

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Background | Midnight Stock | `#0F0F0F` |
| Primary Text | Bone White | `#EDEBE8` |
| Secondary Text | Newsprint Gray | `#8A8A8A` |
| Accent | Oxidized Copper | `#3ECF8E` |
| Rule Lines / Borders | Charcoal | `#2A2A2A` |
| Highlight / Selection | Phosphor Green | `#00FF88` |

**Why it works:** This is the late-night hacker aesthetic elevated to editorial quality. The background is not pure black (which is harsh) but a near-black (#0F0F0F) that feels like heavy matte paper stock. The oxidized copper/green accent (#3ECF8E) is unexpected -- it is not the typical neon green of a terminal but something more refined, like aged copper patina. It references both the natural world and the digital one. The phosphor green highlight (#00FF88) adds a momentary flash of the terminal without committing to the cliche.

## 3. TYPOGRAPHY

### Pairing A: "THE BROADSHEET" (Recommended)

| Role | Font | Weight | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Headlines / Display | **Syne** | 700-800 (Bold/ExtraBold) | Wide, geometric, demands attention. The "Extra" style is particularly powerful at large sizes. Google Fonts. |
| Subheadlines / Section Headers | **Space Grotesk** | 500-700 | Derived from Space Mono. Clean grotesque with just enough personality. Google Fonts. |
| Body / Paragraphs | **Source Serif 4** | 400-600 | Adobe's open-source serif. Readable, credible, editorial. The serif choice grounds the brutalist display type. Google Fonts. |
| Mono / Code / Metadata | **JetBrains Mono** | 400 | The developer's monospace. Ligatures. Designed for code. Google Fonts. |

**Why:** Syne at 120px+ is a weapon. It fills the screen with architectural letterforms that feel like they were chiseled, not typed. Source Serif 4 as body copy is the editorial anchor -- it says "read me, this matters." The contrast between a geometric sans display (Syne) and a humanist serif body (Source Serif) is the exact tension that editorial design lives on.

---

### Pairing B: "THE MANIFESTO"

| Role | Font | Weight | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Headlines / Display | **Darker Grotesque** | 900 (Black) | Condensed, aggressive, impactful. At Black weight it becomes a statement. Google Fonts. |
| Subheadlines | **Inter** | 600 (SemiBold) | The workhorse. Neutral enough to let Darker Grotesque scream. Google Fonts. |
| Body | **Lora** | 400-700 | A balanced serif with roots in calligraphy. Adds warmth to the brutalist frame. Google Fonts. |
| Mono / Code | **Space Mono** | 400-700 | The monospace sibling of Space Grotesk. Consistent family feel. Google Fonts. |

**Why:** Darker Grotesque at Black weight in all-caps is the visual equivalent of someone slamming a newspaper on a desk. It is condensed enough to fit long headlines in tight spaces. Lora as body text softens the blow just enough to keep the reader comfortable.

---

### Pairing C: "THE INDEX"

| Role | Font | Weight | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Headlines / Display | **Epilogue** | 800-900 | A variable font with a wide range. At heavy weights it is architectural. Google Fonts. |
| Subheadlines | **Epilogue** | 400-500 | Same family, lighter weight. Creates cohesion. Google Fonts. |
| Body | **IBM Plex Serif** | 400 | Corporate heritage meets editorial legibility. Perfect for a Walmart developer. Google Fonts. |
| Mono / Code | **IBM Plex Mono** | 400 | Consistent IBM Plex family. Technical. Precise. Google Fonts. |

**Why:** Epilogue is a single-family system that can carry an entire typographic hierarchy. The IBM Plex family for body and code text is a subtle nod to enterprise-scale engineering. For a Walmart developer, this signals: "I build systems, not toys."

## 4. LAYOUT CONCEPTS

### Overall Structure
The site is a single continuous scroll, structured like a newspaper from masthead to classifieds. No traditional "sections" -- instead, editorial zones separated by horizontal rules and column shifts.

## 5. MICRO-INTERACTIONS

All animations in a Brutalist/Editorial portfolio should feel **mechanical, not organic.** No ease-in-out curves. No bouncing. Think: the clack of a printing press, not the flow of water.

### Scroll-Based
- **Headline reveal:** As sections scroll into view, headlines "type" in character by character from left to right, as if being typeset. Use `clip-path` or `overflow: hidden` with translateX. Timing: 300-500ms, `ease: steps(n)` for a stepped/mechanical feel.
- **Column rules fade in:** The vertical lines between columns fade from 0 to 1 opacity as the section enters the viewport. Subtle. 200ms.
- **Section counters increment:** Page numbers ("A1", "A2", "A3") in the margins tick up as you scroll past sections.
- **Parallax dateline:** The date/issue number in the masthead scrolls at 0.5x speed relative to the content, creating a subtle depth.

### Hover-Based
- **Link underlines:** Links have no underline by default. On hover, a 2px underline animates from left to right (not fade, SLIDE). Color: accent.
- **Project headline shift:** On hover, the project headline shifts 8-12px to the right with a `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0, 0, 1)` ease. A small arrow or right-pointing rule appears.
- **Image halftone intensify:** Project images go from subtle halftone to deeper halftone on hover, or invert to high-contrast black and white.
- **Classified item highlight:** Hovering a skill in the classifieds section adds the accent color background, like a highlighter passing over the text.

### Click / State
- **Experience row expand:** Clicking a career index row expands it with a `max-height` transition. The row border-bottom becomes a thicker rule. The text content slides down with a 200ms ease.
- **Navigation marker:** A small, accent-colored square (not circle) follows your scroll position in a minimal side navigation, snapping between section markers.
- **Cursor:** Consider a custom cursor -- a small crosshair or a simple `+` symbol instead of the default pointer. Subtle but distinctive.

### Page Load
- **Masthead sequence:** On initial load, the masthead elements appear in a staggered sequence: newspaper title first (fade + translate up), then the headline, then the pull quote, then the ticker bar. Total duration: 800ms. Each element has a 100ms delay. Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`.
- **Grid lines draw:** On load, the column rules and horizontal rules "draw" themselves -- they start at 0 width/height and extend to full size over 600ms. This mimics the act of ruling lines on a layout board.
- **Print noise:** A very subtle grain/noise overlay (CSS SVG filter) that shifts slightly on page load, like fresh ink settling on paper.

## 6. UNIQUE FEATURES

These are the elements that will make this portfolio unlike any other brutalist portfolio on the internet.

### Feature 1: "Live Print Run" Counter
A running counter in the masthead that shows how many times the portfolio has been viewed, styled as a newspaper print run number: "PRINT RUN: 12,847". Updated via a simple API call. This is both a conversation starter and a subtle flex.

### Feature 2: "The Fold"
A literal visual fold line at ~80vh (viewport height). Content above the fold is structured like front-page news. A subtle CSS effect (a thin gradient shadow or a paper fold texture) marks the transition. Scrolling past "the fold" feels like unfolding a newspaper.

### Feature 3: "Edition Switcher" (Instead of Dark Mode)
No basic dark/light toggle. Instead: an "Edition" switcher in the masthead.
- **Morning Edition** = Light palette (Palette A: Inkwell)
- **Evening Edition** = Dark palette (Palette C: Dark Edition)
- **Sunday Edition** = A special layout with larger typography, more white space, and a featured long-form "interview" style about section

The label and metaphor make the feature memorable. Nobody has an "Edition Switcher."

### Feature 4: "Redacted" Easter Egg
Hovering over certain words reveals "classified" information -- text that appears as black redaction bars (`background: #000; color: #000`) and on hover transitions to reveal the hidden text beneath. Use this for fun facts, salary expectations, or hidden messages. Example: "I have shipped code to [REDACTED] million users."

### Feature 5: "Marginalia"
Small annotations in the margins of the page (like handwritten notes in a newspaper). These are small asides, footnotes, or commentary -- styled in a different typeface (perhaps the mono font, smaller, at an angle). Examples:
- Next to a project: "This one nearly broke me. Worth it."
- Next to a skill: "Learned this at 2am before a deadline."
- These add personality without cluttering the main editorial flow.

### Feature 6: "The Wire" -- Real-Time Activity Feed
A small, persistent "wire service" ticker at the bottom of the page showing recent GitHub commits, blog posts, or activity. Styled like an AP wire ticker. Auto-scrolling, monospaced, with timestamps.

### Feature 7: Newspaper-Style 404 Page
If someone navigates to a non-existent page, they see: "STOP THE PRESSES -- Story Not Found. The editors could not locate the article you requested. Return to the Front Page." Styled as a full editorial error page.

### Feature 8: Print Stylesheet
An actual `@media print` stylesheet that formats the portfolio as a clean, printable resume/CV. When someone hits Ctrl+P, they get a beautifully typeset document. This is a power move that almost no portfolio does.

## 7. HERO SECTION CONCEPT -- EXACTLY WHAT YOU SEE

### First Screen, First Impression

**Viewport:** Full screen. No scrolling required to understand who this person is.

**Top Bar (Masthead Line):**
A thin bar across the full width. Left-aligned: "THE ANSHULL GARG REVIEW" in 11px uppercase Space Grotesk, letter-spacing 3px. Right-aligned: "Vol. I | No. 1 | February 2026 | [City], India" in the same treatment. Below this: a 2px solid black horizontal rule spanning the full width.

**Main Content Area:**
Split into two asymmetric zones by a 1px vertical column rule.

**Left Zone (65% width):**
- Small "kicker" text above the headline: "EXCLUSIVE" in 10px uppercase monospace, with the accent color background (Editorial Red #C41E3A) and white text. Looks like a newspaper section tag.
- The Headline: "SOFTWARE DEVELOPER." in Syne ExtraBold, set at approximately 9vw (scales from ~80px on mobile to ~140px on desktop). Color: Press Black #1A1A1A. All uppercase. Tight letter-spacing (-0.02em). Tight line-height (0.95). This fills the left column and feels monumental.
- Below the headline, separated by 24px of white space: a one-sentence editorial lede in Source Serif 4, 20px, regular weight. "Anshull Garg builds large-scale systems at Walmart, where code serves 240 million customers every week."
- Below the lede: "CONTINUE READING | PAGE A2" as a scroll prompt, styled as a folio reference with a thin downward-pointing line (not an arrow icon -- a CSS-drawn vertical line that subtly pulses).

**Right Zone (35% width):**
- A pull quote block. Large open quotation mark (the character itself, set at 80px in Syne, color: accent red, opacity: 0.3) positioned absolutely in the top-left of this zone.
- The quote itself: "I believe the best software is invisible -- it works so well that no one thinks about it." in Source Serif 4 italic, 18px.
- Attribution: "-- From an interview, 2026" in monospace, 11px.
- Below the quote: a small metadata block listing: "STACK: React, Node.js, Java, AWS" and "STATUS: Open to conversations" in monospace, 11px, separated by thin rules.

**Bottom Ticker Bar:**
A full-width bar at the bottom of the viewport, separated by a 1px rule. Background: very slightly darker than the page (#EDEAE4 vs #F2F0EB). Contains a single line of text in JetBrains Mono 11px, scrolling left continuously: "LATEST -- Shipped checkout optimization at Walmart -- Contributed to open-source project [X] -- Built internal tool serving 500+ engineers -- Currently exploring [topic] -- ..."

**What You Do NOT See:**
- No photo in the hero (it comes in the About section)
- No hamburger menu (navigation is a minimal horizontal list in the masthead: FRONT PAGE | WORKS | PROFILE | INDEX | CONTACT)
- No particle effects, no 3D, no WebGL
- No gradients anywhere
- No border-radius on anything
- No emoji

**The overall feeling:** You have just picked up the most important single-issue publication ever printed about a software developer. It is authoritative. It is confident. It demands to be read.

### Design Mood References
- **The New York Times front page** -- The gold standard of editorial hierarchy. Notice: masthead, headline scale variation, column rules, photo captions, section tags.
- **Bloomberg Businessweek covers** -- Bold, unconventional, sometimes confrontational editorial design. Massive type. Unexpected color. Smart concepts.
- **Emigre Magazine (1984-2005)** -- The legendary typography magazine. Experimental layouts. Type as image. The origin of editorial brutalism.
- **The Brutalist Websites directory (brutalistwebsites.com)** -- The original collection that defined the movement online.
- **Eloy Benoffi's Portfolio (Codrops case study)** -- Glitchy, GSAP-animated brutalist portfolio with intentional chaos.

- **Constructivist posters (El Lissitzky, Rodchenko)** -- Bold geometry, limited color (red, black, white), diagonal compositions, political urgency.
- **Penguin Books covers (original series)** -- Horizontal bands, limited palette, typography-only design. Proof that restraint is powerful.

## 9. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Recommended Stack
- **Next.js 14+** (App Router) -- For SSR, performance, and the print-run counter API route
- **CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS** (with heavy custom config) -- For scoped, maintainable styles
- **GSAP (GreenSock)** -- For scroll-triggered animations and the headline type-in effect
- **CSS Grid** -- The backbone. This layout cannot exist without advanced CSS Grid.
- **Framer Motion** (optional) -- For React-based micro-interactions
- **Vercel** -- For hosting, analytics (view counter), and edge functions

### Performance Targets
- Lighthouse score: 95+ on all metrics
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.0s
- No JavaScript required for core content (progressive enhancement)
- Total page weight: < 500KB (brutalism is inherently lightweight -- no heavy assets)

### Accessibility
- All text meets WCAA AA contrast ratios (the proposed palettes are specifically designed for this)
- Semantic HTML: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
- Skip-to-content link
- Reduced-motion media query respected for all animations
- Screen reader-friendly landmark structure

## 10. SELF-RATING

| Criteria | Score | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Uniqueness** | 9/10 | The newspaper/editorial metaphor applied to a developer portfolio is extremely rare. The "Edition Switcher," "Live Print Run," marginalia, and classified-ads skills section are features I have not seen on any portfolio. The only reason it is not 10/10 is that brutalism as a broader category exists -- but this specific execution is one-of-a-kind. |
| **Memorability** | 10/10 | This is the highest-scoring category. A hiring manager who sees "THE ANSHULL GARG REVIEW" as a newspaper masthead with a print-run counter and classified-style skills will remember it. Period. It is a narrative experience, not a website. Narrative sticks. |
| **Professionalism** | 8/10 | This is where the brutalist direction gets questioned. Some conservative hiring managers may find it "too much." However, the editorial framing (newspaper, not punk zine) keeps it firmly in the professional zone. It is bold, not reckless. The print stylesheet that generates a clean resume is the professionalism insurance policy. Deducting 2 points for the inherent risk of any unconventional approach. |
| **Technical Impressiveness** | 9/10 | Advanced CSS Grid with asymmetric column spans and column rules. Custom scroll-based animations. GSAP timelines. Print stylesheets. Halftone image filters. Edition switching with full palette and layout changes. Dynamic print-run counter via API. Responsive newspaper layouts. This is a technical showcase disguised as a design showcase. |
| **Hiring Impact** | 9/10 | For the right companies (tech companies, product teams, startups, forward-thinking enterprise teams at Walmart), this is a 10/10. It demonstrates: technical CSS mastery, design thinking, attention to detail, creative confidence, and the ability to build complex layouts. For very conservative enterprises, it might be an 8. Averaged: 9. |

### **Overall: 9.0 / 10**

## THE CLOSING ARGUMENT

Every other design direction you are considering right now -- the minimalist one, the 3D one, the "modern clean" one -- will produce a portfolio that looks like it was made in 2024 and will look dated by 2027.

**This direction is timeless.** Newspapers have looked roughly the same for 300 years because the underlying design principles (hierarchy, contrast, grid, typography) are eternal. A Brutalist/Editorial portfolio built today will look just as intentional in five years.

**This direction is technically demanding.** It proves you can build things that most developers cannot. Asymmetric CSS Grid layouts with column rules, responsive editorial typography, scroll-driven animations with GSAP, print stylesheets -- this is a masterclass in web development disguised as a portfolio.

**This direction tells a story.** You are not showing a list of projects. You are publishing an edition. You are the editor-in-chief of your own career. Every section has a narrative purpose. Every design choice has an editorial justification.

**This direction is the one they will remember.**

Choose the direction that makes people stop scrolling.
